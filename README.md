# 📐 Mathematics – Manim Visualizations

Mathematics is the language behind everything we explore at Sam SciTech. This folder contains Manim-based visual code used to transform abstract mathematical ideas into clear, cinematic animations - making math intuitive, visual, and deeply connected to physics, astronomy, and the beauty of the universe.

This repository contains **high-quality Manim animations** created for the
**Sam SciTech YouTube Channel**, focused on explaining mathematical concepts
with clarity, intuition, and visual depth.

The goal of this project is to make abstract mathematics
**visually intuitive, precise, and engaging** for students, engineers,
and science enthusiasts.
